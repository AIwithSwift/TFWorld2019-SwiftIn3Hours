/*
 Swift is a compiled, statically typed, multiparadigm language designed to be **safe** and **fast**. First released by Apple in 2014, it was built upon the LLVM compiler framework and allows for C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to coexist within a single application. It is also entirely Open Source (yay!).
 
 At its core, Swift is inspired by the C family of languages; it takes a lot of its basics from the well-established syntax of its predecessors. Though quite a few hard requirements have been removed for cleanliness in Swift, there is often nothing stopping you from doing it anyway--such as is the case with statement-ending semicolons.
 */
1 + 1; // for example, this line executes just fine with a semicolon on the end

2 + 2  // but so does this, so why bother?

/*:
 # Types
 
 Swift comes with all the standard types straight out of the box: Strings, Integers, Doubles (floating point numbers), Booleans and many more. Types are simply declared and types with a neat and readable syntax. We'll start with the basics...
 */
//: Stored values can be variable or constant, whose value cannot be changed once assigned. These are determined by the use of the 'var' or 'let' keyword in their initial declaration. This can be used to keep safe the values you need to know but that you want to make sure are never changed. Xcode will pick up on any violations at compile time.
var integerVariable: Int = 1
integerVariable = 2 // perfectly fine to do

let integerConstant: Int = 1
//integerConstant = 2 // ERROR: Cannot assign to value: 'integerConstant' is a 'let' constant
//: Declarations can also be explicitly or implicitly typed--this is sometimes called Static Typing versus Type Inference. Where not declared, Swift will default to whichever basic type it thinks is most likely based on what value you initially give it, if it is able. Because of this, a declaration that is not being assigned a value in the same line cannot be implicitly-typed.
let explicitInteger: Int = 1
type(of: explicitInteger) // Integer Type

let implicitInteger = 1
type(of: implicitInteger) // also an Integer Type
//: This works for quite a few different types of values, but not always as you'd expect.
let implicitDouble = 1.0
type(of: implicitDouble)

let implicitString = "s"
type(of:implicitString) // NOTE: it does not infer Char for single-character Strings
//: To be sure, you can always option-click on a variable's name to see its Type.
var mysteryTypedVariable = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1.0]
//: As well as the Playgrounds environment, Swift itself also supports full Unicode in its Strings. Yes, you can make emoji variable names. No, you should not make emoji variable names. But this support is great for not breaking other things and for robust localization.
let ðŸ¦• = "dinosaur"
let dinosaur = "ðŸ¦–"
//: Swift is a **very** strongly typed language, and the compiler is very picky about ensuring type safety. Many types however support direct typecasting:
let typeCastDouble = 1 as Double
//: For others, they may require a custom function to be written or some extra information. But usually it is a simple case of initialising the new type with the old value, like so:
let typecastDouble = Double(integerVariable)
let typecastInteger = Int(typecastDouble)

//: Collection types such as Arrays and Dictionaries are especially clean and intuitive in Swift. They can easily be declared and manipulated with literals that leave the initialisation to the machine.
var stringArray = ["First element", "Second element", "Third element"]
stringArray += ["More Array elements", "Can be added en masse", "As either addition of two or more Arrays"]
stringArray.append("Or as one element at a time")
//: You can insert, find or remove elements in many ways, as well as obtaining subsequences, descriptions, hashes and more of the Array.
stringArray.insert("Zero-th element", at: 0)
stringArray.count
stringArray.dropLast(4)
//: You can also directly insert and address elements using subscripts:
stringArray[0] = "New Zero-th element"
let secondElement = stringArray[1]
/*:
 # Operators
 
 It's a programming langauge: it has maths and logic. You can do maths with the math bits and logic with the logic bits and sometimes--*if you're feeling saucy*--logic with the maths bits or maths with the logic bits.
 */
//: Swift has some math operators you would expect...
let addition        = 2 + 1 // two plus one
let subtraction     = 2 - 1 // two minus one
let multiplication  = 2 * 1 // two times one
let division        = 2 / 1 // two divided by one (integer division)
let modulo          = 2 % 1 // remainder from two integer division one
//: ...it also doesn't have some you might expect though...
//let exponential     = 2 ** 1 // ERROR: Use of unresolved operator '**' (doesn't exist in Swift)
let exponential     = pow(2, 1) // two to the power of one (function included in Foundation library)
//: ...it has some comparison operators too...
let greater   = 2 > 1  // boolean representing whether two is greater than one
let less      = 2 < 1  // boolean representing whether two is less than one
let equal     = 2 == 1 // boolean representing whether two is equal to one
//: ...and some compound operators for some of the above put together.
// you can skip steps when changing and then re-assigning in one step
var number = 2
//number = number + 1
number += 1 // left side equals left side plus right side (addition and assignment in one step)
//number = number - 2
number -= 2 // left side equals left side minus right side (subtraction and assignment in one step)
//number = number * 4
number *= 4 // left side equals left side times by right side (multiplication and assignment in one step)
//number = number / 2
number /= 2 // left side equals left side divided by right side (division and assignment in one step)


// but not in the way many other languages allow
//number++ // ERROR: Unary operator '++' cannot be applied to an operand of type '@lvalue Int' (doesn't exist, such unary operators deprecated from the language in Swift 3)


// you can be less restrictive in your checks
let greaterOrEqual  = 2 >= 1 // boolean representing whether two is greater than OR EQUAL TO one
let lessOrEqual     = 2 <= 1 // boolean representing whether two is less than OR EQUAL TO one
let notEqual        = 2 != 1 // boolean representing whether two is not equal to one


// or more restrictive
class SomeObject {}     // some fake object class
let oneObject       = SomeObject()  // a default object of that class
let anotherObject   = SomeObject()  // another default object of that class

let same            = oneObject === anotherObject // boolean representing whether oneObject and anotherObject are THE SAME OBJECT, regardless of whether they have the same values

/*:
 There are also a range of operators for bitwise calculation or manipulation and and compound operators that allow overflow handling in multiplication and division, but that is likely more maths than you will need at this point. You can declare your own operators too, similarly to how you'd declare a function. More details can be found [here](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html) and [here](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html).
 
 As you saw above with some String manipulation, there is also the "dot" operator. This accesses properties and functions that the preceding variable or type has. For example...
 */
stringArray.count       // every Array type has an inbuilt value called "count" that will return an Int representing the number of elements it contains
stringArray.removeAll() // Arrays also have the ability to clear all their elements at once
//: When we talk about custom types a little later, you will see how you can give new values and behaviours to existing and custom types that can then be accessed this way.
/*:
 # Flow Control
 
 So we can now write lines of code and run them in order. That's all well and good, but what about when we want to run--or even repeat--different segments depending on or to cause different behaviours? We need flow control structures: things that allow us to skip or repeat code.
 */
//: You can use the "if" or "if-else" structure to take different paths or omit code based on certain conditions.
// declare some values
var thing = 1
var otherThing = 2


// and you can check them with a structure like this
if thing == otherThing {
    otherThing += 1
}


// or this
var greatest = 0

if thing > otherThing {
    
    greatest = thing
} else {
    
    greatest = otherThing
}

//: But who could forget a personal favourite of ours, the ternary operator. This question mark-colon pairing means "if the first third is true then do the second third, else the third third". It's a handy and readable shorthand.
greatest = thing > otherThing ? thing : otherThing

//  reads as greatest equals (if thing > otherthing then thing else otherThing)
//: This is also useful for doing different actions based on a boolean check
let todayString = String(describing: Date()) // the datetime right now as a String
//todayString.hasPrefix("2018-07-19 16") ? print("It's TALK TIME!") : print("False Alarm")

//: You can run a block multiple times until a desired point is reached using a "while" loop.
let answer = 10
var guess = -1

while guess != answer {
    
    guess =  Int.random(in: 0 ... 10) // a random number between 0 and 10
}
// to get here the block above will need to repeat one to theoretically infinite times
// once you get here, you know guess must equal answer

//: Where iteration indices are needed or a loop should happen a fixed number of times, "for-in" loops can be used. There are many forms of the syntax that can be used for this, here are just a few examples:
var numbers = [1, 5, 10]
var sum = 0


// OPTION 1: a numeric range
for number in 0..<numbers.count { // for number in 0 to less than 3 (0, 1, 2)
    sum += numbers[number]
}

sum


// OPTION 2: a collection
for number in numbers { // for each item in collection
    sum += number
}

sum

// OPTION 3: a handy combination of the two
var status = ""

for (index, value) in numbers.enumerated() {
    status += "Loop \(index + 1): \(value) was added. "
    sum += number
}

sum

//: Other structures are used to ensure code is only run if other unsafe conditions do not occur, or to recover from them if they do. The "do try-catch" structure is a good catch-all for wrapping unsafe blocks of code in.
let unsafeVariable: String? = "Some unsafe value we're not sure will be valid at runtime."


//extension String: Error {} // make some new object that can BE an Error

/// A function that can "throw" an error
func threeHater(_ input: Int) throws {
    
    let error = "INPUT WAS A THREE! ARGH!"
    
    if input == 3 {
        throw error
    }
}


do {

} catch {
    
    // throw an error or perform a recovery here
    // multiple "catch" clauses can be used to catch different error conditions where needed
    print(error)
}

# Optionals

Swift basic types are non-nullable: if they have ever been initialised they can never NOT have a value of their declared of inferred type. Clean types are all well and good, and these restrictions are some of what makes Swift such a safe language, but in the real world we often pass around objects or values we didn't create or have complete control over.

Enter the Optional type.

/*:
 However, while this makes the value nullable, it does not allow us the same operations as the original non-Optional type does. To do many things, we must do more than just assume there will be a value to operate on (because the compiler just doesn't trust you any more, you've been wrong before). So we have to perform an "unwrapping" to extract the value as its underlying type. To do so, there are a few options:
 - Using an exclamation mark on an optional Type. Basically saying to the compiler "there will be a number, trust me". **This will crash if you are wrong. Don't do this; you are not too cool for memory safety!**
 - A let-var structure. Basically "if this assignment to a non-Optional type resolves without crashing, do the thing within the block".
 - A guard-let structure. Basically the opposite, "if this assignment to a non-Optional type causes a crash, do the thing within the block".

 Sometimes you've figured out a clever way to do something, but it takes a lot of steps and you don't want to clutter up your code--or more likely you'll be wanting to use it more than once. To avoid the re-writing of code, we can give a set of steps a name that we can call it by. These are called functions.

//: Swift has two main types (of types): value and reference types. Classes are **reference** types, which are shared instances whose modifications are shared. Structs, enums and Tuples are **value** types, which are separate instances who will suffer changes independently (effectively, minus some compiler optimisation). For example, a reference type:

class ClassType { // we make a reference-typed thing
    var foo: Int = 0
}

var classVariable = ClassType() // we instantiate a thing

let classDuplicate = classVariable // we "duplicate" the thing

classVariable.foo = 5 // we change its value

classDuplicate.foo // its duplicate is also changed, as it is just a variable that refers to the same object
//: ...versus a value type:
struct StructType { // we make a value-typed thing
    var bar: Int
}

var structVariable = StructType(bar: 0) // we instantiate the thing

let structDuplicate = structVariable // we duplicate the thing

structVariable.bar = 5 // we change its value

structDuplicate.bar // the duplicate is not changed, it is a separate entity

//: Up Next: **Enumerations**!. Enums are a personal favourite in the Swift language; they are not just a list of possible related values like in other languages, they can store alternative values, attributes, functions and all sorts of things.

    case weekday, weekend

 Enums can also be given associated values, allowing different cases to each store different values.

 # Protocols
 
 Sometimes you know you will have an object but, much like we said with the need for optional variables, you can't be sure what it will be exactly. It could be that you don't know what it is yet but you know what it will need to do, or that it could be one of multiple different but similar things that should be treated the same in this context. In comes **protocols**, one of the coolest things about the Swift language. This is much like an Interface in other languages, there are high-level declarations for other things to adhere to.
 
 Many argue that despite it being possible to program in Swift using entirely Object-Oriented approaches, it is in fact its most powerful when regarded as a protocol-based language. Let's look at some of the cool stuff you can do with the use of protocols...

 Using a protocol is similar to inheriting from a class, it just goes at the top of the declaration. To differentiate, protocols will often be named as an adjective (e.g. something-able) to differentiate that it is a declaration of ability, whereas superclasses will often be named as a noun (e.g. thing), but this is not enforced.
 
 Stylistically, separating these out into separate class extensions for each adherence keeps your files clean and makes it simpler to trace which protocol each value or function exists to adhere to.
