^ Let's go back to our plan for a moment..

# **Today's Plan**

1. **Swift (for programming)**
2. Swift (for TensorFlow)
3. Using Swift for TensorFlow
4. Using everything

^ We're gonna start with Swift, for programming.

---

# **Swift (for programming)**

^ We're going to be teaching Swift, as a programming language, for the first bit of this tutorial. We're kind of just ignoring machine learning for this. It's important to learn Swift as a programming language before we move to Swift for TensorFlow.

# Activity | Basic XOR | Model

```swift
import TensorFlow

// Create a XORModel Struct
struct XORModel: Layer
{
  // define three layers, each of Dense type
  var inputLayer = Dense<Float>(inputSize: 2, outputSize: 2, activation: sigmoid)
  var hiddenLayer = Dense<Float>(inputSize: 2, outputSize: 2, activation: sigmoid)
  var outputLayer = Dense<Float>(inputSize: 2, outputSize: 1, activation: sigmoid)
  
  // procide the differentiable thingo
  @differentiable func callAsFunction(_ input: Tensor<Float>) -> Tensor<Float>
  {
    return input.sequenced(through: inputLayer, hiddenLayer, outputLayer)
  }
}

## Activity | Basic XOR | Preparing for Training

```swift
// create an instance of our XORModel Struct (defined above)
var model = XORModel()

// create an optimizer (standard gradient descent)
let optimizer = SGD(for: model, learningRate: 0.02)

// create some training data
let trainingData: Tensor<Float> = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]

// label the training data (so we know the correct outputs)
let trainingLabels: Tensor<Float> = [[0], [1], [1], [0]]
```

# Activity | Basic XOR | Training the Model

```swift
// train to 100,000
for epoch in 0..<100_000
{
    // do the ting
    let ùõÅmodel = model.gradient { model -> Tensor<Float> in
        let ≈∑ = model(trainingData)
        let loss = meanSquaredError(predicted: ≈∑, expected: trainingLabels)
        if epoch % 5000 == 0
          print("epoch: \(epoch) loss: \(loss)")
        return loss

<!-- Specifically, this tutorial will:

begin with a Swift programming tutorial, covering how to use Swift, as a programming language (we‚Äôll use both Apple‚Äôs playgrounds, if you have a macOS device, as well as Jupyter notebooks)

move to a Swift for TensorFlow tutorial, exploring fundamental machine learning problem solving using TensorFlow and Swift

explore and demonstrate common use cases for TensorFlow, using Swift

demonstrate the use of numpy, the ubiquitous Python library, from Swift, to perform common and useful data science operations, and 
integrate the results with Swift for TensorFlow

conclude be bringing all the components together: Swift programming (in a notebook), showcasing common ML problem-solving processes using Swift for TensorFlow, and integrating Python libraries as needed in a pragmatic manner -->
