3:00 PM to 3:30 PM (break)
3:30 PM to 5:00 PM (90 minutes)

# Timeline 
* Welcome/introductions/setup (10 minutes)
	- who are we
	- what's Swift
	- you should have done all this setup <setup>
	- here's what we're gonna do today
	- here's our focus/approach to teaching this

* Introduction to the tools (5 minutes)
	- we're gonna use the Swift for TensorFlow toolchain, not Apple's Swift toolchain
	- quick overview of Jupyter 
	- quick overview of Google Colab

* Swift Programming (30 minutes)
	- how to program with Swift (10 minutes)
	- Swift's unique bits (focusing on what's useful to S4TF, like enumerations, extensions, protocols, etc.) (15 minutes)
	* ACTIVITY: Swift Programming (30 minutes)

* Recap/summary of Swift Programming (5 minutes)
	- what have we learned?
	- what's next?

* Introduction to Swift for TensorFlow (10 minutes)
	- using Tensors
	- Differentiable programming

 _Break_

* Swift for TensorFlow + Python (10 minutes)
	- Python interop is powerful
	- what it can do
	- why bother?
	* ACTIVITY: Swift for TensorFlow + Python Activity (15 minutes)
		- using matplotlib
		- using ? (Scikit?)
		- mixing Python and Swift
	
* Swift for TensorFlow Basics (15 minutes)
	- creating a simple model (XOR?)
	- giving it some data
	- training it
	- using it
	* ACTIVITY: Super basic Swift for TensorFlow Activity (15 minutes)
		- something slightly (but not much) more complex than the XOR example for attendees to do themselves.. ?

* Bringing it all together with a bigger model and` training (15 minutes)
	* ACTIVITY: Bringing it all together (15 minutes)

* Summary and end (5 minutes)
