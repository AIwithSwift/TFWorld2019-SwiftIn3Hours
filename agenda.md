7. ACTIVITY 7: Bringing it all together (Linear Regressor) (Paris leads, Tim and Mars support)

### Extras

Just in case we need more material:

1. Fahrenheit to Celsius
2. Raw TensorFlow (very simple)

# Timeline 

** Paris starts**

* Welcome/introductions/setup (10 minutes) (PARIS)
	- who are we
	- what's Swift
	- you should have done all this setup <
	- here's what we're gonna do today
	- here's our focus/approach to teaching this

* Introduction to the tools (5 minutes) (PARIS)
	- we're gonna use the Swift for TensorFlow toolchain, not Apple's Swift toolchain
	- quick overview of Jupyter 
	- quick overview of Google Colab
	- ACTIVITY 1: Make sure everything is working
		- Ask everyone to open Colab

** switch to Mars **	

* Swift Programming (~60 minutes) (Mars)
	- ACTIVITY 2: Welcome to Swift
	- ACTIVITY 3: Getting Familiar with Swift

* Recap/summary of Swift Programming (5 minutes)
	- what have we learned?
	- what's next?

** switch to Tim **

* Swift for TensorFlow Basics (XOR) (Tim)
	- creating a simple model for XOR
		- giving it some data
		- training it
		- using it
	- ACTIVITY 4: Super basic Swift for TensorFlow Activity (XOR) (TIM)
		- Participants should open the "STARTER" version of Activity 4 and code in the cells that say "CODE GOES HERE". TIM to code in the "CODE GOES HERE" fields as well (in his own version of STARTER).
		- If Participants just want to follow along, or copy paste, they should also open the FINAL version of ACTIVITY 4.
		
* Swift for TensorFlow + Python (10 minutes)
	- Python interop is powerful
	- what it can do
	- why bother?
	* ACTIVITY 5: BOLTING A TINY BIT OF PYTHON ONTO THE XOR (TIM) (15 minutes)
		- Participants should open the "STARTER" version of Activity 5 and code in the cells that say "CODE GOES HERE". TIM to code in the "CODE GOES HERE" fields as well (in his own version of STARTER).
		- If Participants just want to follow along, or copy paste, they should also open the FINAL version of ACTIVITY 5.
		- Participants and/or Tim could also just continue coding in the Activity 4 notebook.
	
* ACTIVITY 6: Training a bigger model (GAN) (Paris leads, Tim and Mars support)
		- Participants should open the "STARTER" version of Activity 6 and code in the cells that say "CODE GOES HERE". TIM to code in the "CODE GOES HERE" fields as well (in his own version of STARTER).
		- If Participants just want to follow along, or copy paste, they should also open the FINAL version of ACTIVITY 6.

* ACTIVITY 7: Bringing it all together (Linear Regressor) (Paris leads, Tim and Mars support)
		- Participants should open the "STARTER" version of Activity 7 and code in the cells that say "CODE GOES HERE". TIM to code in the "CODE GOES HERE" fields as well (in his own version of STARTER).
		- If Participants just want to follow along, or copy paste, they should also open the FINAL version of ACTIVITY 7.
