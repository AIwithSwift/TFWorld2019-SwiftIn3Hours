THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR PRESENTERS NOT ATTENDEES

1:30 PM to 3:00 PM (90 minutes)
3:00 PM to 3:30 PM (break)
3:30 PM to 5:00 PM (90 minutes)

## Activities 

1. Make Sure Everything is Working
2. SWIFT TBD
3. SWIFT TBD
4. Making a Basic XOR Model 
5. Swift, meet Python
6. Training a bigger model (GAN)
7. Bringing it all together (Linear Regressor)

### Extras

1. Fahrenheit to Celsius
2. Raw TensorFlow (very simple)

# Timeline 
* Welcome/introductions/setup (10 minutes)
	- who are we
	- what's Swift
	- you should have done all this setup <setup>
	- here's what we're gonna do today
	- here's our focus/approach to teaching this

* Introduction to the tools (5 minutes)
	- we're gonna use the Swift for TensorFlow toolchain, not Apple's Swift toolchain
	- quick overview of Jupyter 
	- quick overview of Google Colab
	- ACTIVITY 1: Make sure everything is working
		- Ask everyone to open Colab
		- TODO: Have a simple test notebook to make sure it's working
		
* Swift Programming (~60 minutes)
	- step through the TFWorld2019_SwiftProgramming Playground (but in Jupyter) and show how Swift programming works.
		- attendees have all the code provided up front, and can choose to step through or code as we go
		- we'll stop at several (TODO TBD) points for an ACTIVITY:
			- ACTIVITY 2: Welcome to Swift
			- ACTIVITY 3: Getting Familiar with Swift

* Recap/summary of Swift Programming (5 minutes)
	- what have we learned?
	- what's next?

* Introduction to Swift for TensorFlow (10 minutes)
	- SLIDES:
		- What is S4TF
		- using Tensors
		- Differentiable programming
	- ACTIVITY:	Hello TensorFlow 
	
 _Break_ (approx)

* Swift for TensorFlow Basics (15 minutes)
	- creating a simple model (XOR?)
		- giving it some data
		- training it
		- using it
	- ACTIVITY: Super basic Swift for TensorFlow Activity (XOR?) (15 minutes)
		- TBD? something slightly (but not much) more complex than the XOR example for attendees to do themselves.. ?
		
* Swift for TensorFlow + Python (10 minutes)
	- Python interop is powerful
	- what it can do
	- why bother?
	* ACTIVITY: Swift for TensorFlow + Python Activity (15 minutes)
		- using matplotlib
		- using ? (Scikit?)
		- mixing Python and Swift
	
* Bringing it all together with a bigger model and` training (15 minutes)
	* ACTIVITY: Bringing it all together (15 minutes)

* Summary and end (5 minutes)
